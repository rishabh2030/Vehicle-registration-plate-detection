# Vehicle-registration-plate-detection
Vehicle registration plate detection (VRPD) is a combination of image processing, character  segmentation and recognition technologies used to identify vehicles by their license plates. Since  only the license plate information is used for identification, this technology requires no  additional hardware to be installed on vehicles.
